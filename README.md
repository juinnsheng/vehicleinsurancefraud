# Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection using Artificial Intelligence

Techniques implemented

Class imbalance: SMOTE-ENN

Modelling: Logistic Regression, 
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, 
KNN, Neural Network, XGBoost, AdaBoost, CatBoost, DNN, LSTM, Graph-SAGE (adapted from https://github.com/williamleif/graphsage-simple/blob/master/graphsage/model.py)

Stratified 5-fold cross validation and applied GridSearchCV are applied for our hyperparameter
tuning. To evaluate and compare the performances of each model, metrics such as accuracy,
precision, F1-score, Recall and AUC score were applied.
